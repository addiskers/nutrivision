# ============================================================
# OCR PROMPT
# ============================================================
OCR_PROMPT = """
Extract all text exactly as visible in the image.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULE (CRITICAL):
You are a strict OCR engine.

- Extract ONLY characters that are physically visible.
- Never infer, reconstruct, or complete missing words, numbers, or table rows.
- If text is partially visible → extract only the visible part.
- If a value is unclear → write NA.

Never generate nutrition values, ingredients, or numbers that are not visible.
Never use food knowledge to complete nutrition tables.

--------------------------------------------------
NUMERIC AUTHENTICITY RULE (CRITICAL):

Long numeric sequences (8+ digits) must be copied ONLY if every digit is clearly visible.

Rules:
- Do NOT guess or complete digits.
- If any digit is unclear → output NA.
- Never generate regulatory numbers (FSSAI, GST, barcode, batch, phone) from context.

--------------------------------------------------
CROSSED-OUT / CANCELLED TEXT DETECTION:

Mark text as:
[CROSSED: text]

ONLY when clearly cancelled by:
1. Horizontal strike line through text
2. Two diagonal lines forming X
3. Marker/pen cancellation line across text

Strict rules:
- Line must visibly cross the text
- Line must be separate from characters
- Symbols like *, #, ^ near a price are NOT cancellation
- Do NOT mark text as [CROSSED] if only a symbol (*, #, ^, @, -) is present near it. There must be a visible line crossing the text.
- Dot-matrix printing or random dots are NOT strikethrough
- If unsure → treat as normal text

Examples:
₹50 with strike line → [CROSSED: ₹50]
MRP ₹120 with X mark → [CROSSED: MRP ₹120]

--------------------------------------------------
TABLE EXTRACTION:

Apply table formatting ONLY if a table is clearly visible.

For visible tables (nutrition or ingredients):

<label> | <value1> | <value2> | <value3>

Rules:
- Extract ONLY visible rows
- If a value cell is unreadable → NA
- NEVER create new rows
- NEVER fill missing values

--------------------------------------------------
NUTRITION EXTRACTION GATE:

Output nutrition rows ONLY if the image contains one of these headers:

- Nutrition
- Nutrition Facts
- Nutritional Information

If none are visible → DO NOT output nutrition rows.

--------------------------------------------------
SYMBOL EXTRACTION RULES:

Capture ALL symbols exactly as printed.

Must extract symbols such as:
*, #, ^, ~, †, ‡, ※, ⁂, °, +, ', ", •, ·

Rules:
- Preserve symbol placement exactly
- Extract even faint or tiny symbols
- Do NOT ignore superscripts or micro-marks
- Do NOT remove symbols near claims, ingredients, or nutrition values

--------------------------------------------------
GRAPHICAL ICON RULE:
- If an icon appears on the packaging:
    • Identify the symbol and its color/meaning, if applicable.
    • Map recognized symbols to standard text as follows:
        - Green Dot symbol → [GREEN DOT]
        - Brown Dot symbol → [BROWN DOT]
        - Recycle / ♻ symbol → [RECYCLABLE]
- If the icon is not recognized or has no clear meaning, extract the visible symbol as-is (e.g., ●, ♻) and include a placeholder.
- Preserve the symbol exactly as printed in the OCR text, and store the mapped meaning in the JSON array "claims": [].
- Do NOT invent new meanings for unrecognized symbols.

--------------------------------------------------
DATE PRESERVATION RULE (CRITICAL):

Dates must be preserved EXACTLY as printed.
Do NOT normalize or rewrite dates.

Examples of valid formats:

12/05/2024
12-05-2024
08/2024
08.2024
15/03/25
OCT 2024
OCT.2024
OCT. 2024
02/DEC/2022
29/NOV/2023
AUG/24-AUG/25
08/2024 - 08/2026

Rules:
- Do NOT change separators (/ - .)
- Do NOT convert month names
- Do NOT remove dots after month names
- Do NOT merge numbers

Extract ALL visible dates (MFG, PKD, EXP, USE BY).
--------------------------------------------------
FIELD ASSOCIATION RULE (CRITICAL):
- A value must ONLY be attached to a label if it appears on the SAME LINE or immediately after the label.
- If a number appears on a different line or floating → DO NOT assume it belongs to the label.
- If the label has no clearly attached value → output the label exactly as printed.
- If location is ambiguous → leave number on its own line.
- Never guess or move numbers between lines.

LABEL COMPLETION RULE:
- Do NOT attach numbers to a label if the number is on a separate line.
- If a label ends with ":" and no value is visible on the same line → leave label empty.

--------------------------------------------------
GENERAL OUTPUT RULE:

Return the text exactly as seen:
- line by line
- same order
- same spacing
- same mistakes
- include all symbols

If OCR cannot read a value → write NA.
Do NOT fill values from context.

Example output (misaligned pack handled correctly):

MAX. RETAIL PRICE: ₹ 139.00
[Inclusive of all taxes]
A21021
BATCH NO.:
10/2021
MFG DATE:
"""

# ============================================================
# STRUCTURE PROMPT TEMPLATE  (raw_text is injected at call time)
# ============================================================
STRUCTURE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You MUST extract every meaningful detail from the OCR text WITHOUT summarizing or skipping important fields.

==================================================
PRODUCT NAME RULE
==================================================
Product Name = ONLY:
- Brand
- Product category
- Variant / flavor
- Quantity descriptors (e.g., Sugar Free, Lite)

DO NOT include:
- Slogans, taglines, or marketing lines.

Examples:
✔ Bisk Farm Cream Cracker Sugar Free
✔ Cadbury Bournville 70% Dark Chocolate

==================================================
CROSSED-OUT TEXT HANDLING (CRITICAL)
==================================================
PRIORITY RULE: When extracting MRP or any other field:
1. If text appears as [CROSSED: value], IGNORE it completely.
2. Extract ONLY the non-crossed value.
3. If multiple MRP values exist:
   - Use the one WITHOUT [CROSSED: ] marker
   - Discard the one WITH [CROSSED: ] marker

Example in OCR text:
  [CROSSED: ₹ 48] ₹ 46/-
  → Extract: ₹ 46/- (ignore the crossed value entirely)

Apply this rule to ALL fields, not just MRP.

==================================================
CORE EXTRACTION RULES
==================================================
Extract EXACTLY as printed:
- All manufacturers, packers, addresses.
- Packaging material manufacturer.
- All barcode/EAN numbers.
- All batch/lot/pack/manufacturing codes.
- All machine codes.
- All storage instructions.
- All claims/certifications.
- ALWAYS set "pack_details.packing_format" to "" even if packaging type (Bottle, Pouch, Box, etc.) is clearly mentioned in OCR.

DO NOT infer or modify any information.
DO NOT treat decorative text as meaningful.

==================================================
DATE EXTRACTION AND CALCULATION RULES
==================================================
1. Extract all dates exactly as printed in the OCR text.
   This includes manufacturing dates (MFG), expiry dates (EXP), best-before statements,
   and any other date references.

2. Standardize all identified dates to the format:
   DD/MM/YYYY

3. Handling partial dates:
   - If a date contains only month and year (e.g., JAN-25, JAN 2025, 01-2025),
     assume the first day of that month.
     Example:
     JAN-25 → 01/01/2025

4. Expiry calculation from Best Before:
   - If a manufacturing date is present and a Best Before duration is specified
     (example: "BEST BEFORE 15 MONTHS FROM MANUFACTURE"),
     you MUST calculate expiry_date by adding the mentioned duration to
     the manufacture_date.
   - expiry_date must never be "Not Specified" in this case.

5. Shelf life rules:
   - If the Best Before duration is explicitly mentioned, use that value
     directly as shelf_life (example: "15 months").
   - If shelf life is NOT explicitly mentioned but BOTH manufacture_date
     and expiry_date are present, you MUST calculate shelf_life.
   - shelf_life = difference between expiry_date and manufacture_date
     calculated in months.
   - Return shelf_life in months.

   Example:
   manufacture_date: 01/11/2024
   expiry_date: 01/02/2026
   shelf_life: 15 months

6. Always populate shelf_life whenever possible based on the above rules.

   If BOTH manufacture_date and expiry_date exist,
   shelf_life must NEVER be "Not Specified".

7. All final dates in the structured output must be in DD/MM/YYYY format.

8. If no manufacturing date, expiry date, best-before statement, or shelf life
   information is found in the OCR text, return:
   manufacture_date: "Not Specified"
   expiry_date: "Not Specified"
   shelf_life: "Not Specified"

9. Do NOT modify, reinterpret, or correct other extracted text.
   Calculations are only allowed for expiry_date and shelf_life.

==================================================
TEXT PRESERVATION RULE (CRITICAL)
==================================================
Preserve ALL visible OCR text.
1. First extract and store all meaningful text into the appropriate JSON fields.
2. If text does NOT clearly belong to any defined field, store it under:
"other_important_text": []

This includes slogans, taglines, marketing text, environmental messages, disclaimers, regulatory notes, preparation notes, miscellaneous packaging text, and brand communication messages.
Rules:
- Preserve text exactly as printed.
- Do NOT summarize or rewrite.
- Store each line as a separate array item.

Final Safety Rule:
- After structured extraction, ensure any remaining partial, fragmented, or half-structured OCR text that was not mapped to fields is also preserved in "other_important_text".
- This guarantees no meaningful OCR text is lost.

==================================================
USPF RULE (NEW)
==================================================
Any price that contains "/Unit", "/g", "/ml", "/kg", "/pc", "/tablet", "/capsule"
or similar unit formats is NOT an MRP.
Extract it as: **USPF**

Example:
₹120.00/Unit → **USPF**: ₹120.00/Unit
₹ 0.14/g → **USPF**: ₹ 0.14/g

- DO NOT merge it with MRP.
- DO NOT place it under "Other Important Text".

==================================================
NUTRITION JSON RULE (STRICT)
==================================================
You MUST output the nutrition table ONLY as JSON.
JSON Format:
[
{{
"nutrient_name": "<as printed>",
"unit": "<unit printed for that nutrient>",
"values": {{
    "<column header>": "<value>"
    }}
}}
]

Rules:
- NO Markdown tables.
- NO ```json fences around the JSON.
- Use exact nutrient row names exactly as printed on packaging.
- Extract the UNIT printed for that nutrient (examples: g, mg, µg, kcal, kJ, IU).
- The unit usually appears in brackets next to the nutrient name (example: Protein (g)).
- If the unit appears in the column header instead of the nutrient name, still extract the correct unit for that nutrient.
- Store ONLY the unit in the "unit" field (do NOT include brackets).
- Do NOT attach the unit to numeric values.
- Column headers must remain EXACT.
- If RDA value is missing or blank, return: "not specified".
- Do NOT return empty strings for any RDA values.

Dynamic column handling:
- Identify the table header row, if present, and map each column to its header.
- First column = "nutrient_name".
- Any numeric column with a clear header → use that header as the key.
- If a middle numeric column has no header → treat it as "per_serving".
- If a column contains "%" or "%RDA", preserve the header exactly as printed (including symbols like *, #).
- Preserve all symbols (*, **, †, ‡) exactly as printed.
- If a value is missing or unclear → return "not specified".

NUTRITION NOTES:
Store nutrition footnotes, explanations, and reference statements related to the nutrition table under:

"nutrition_notes": []

These usually appear:
- Below the nutrition table
- After symbols like *, **, ^, †
- As lines explaining %RDA, serving references, or nutrient definitions.
Rules:
- Extract ONLY if the text actually appears in the OCR.
- Preserve symbols (*, **, ^, †, etc.) exactly as printed.
- Do NOT merge these lines into the nutrition table rows.
- If no nutrition notes are present in the OCR text, return: []
IMPORTANT:
Examples below are for reference only. NEVER copy them into the output unless the exact text appears in the OCR.

Examples:
- "*other than naturally occurring trans fat"
- "**RDA calculated based on 2000 kcal diet"
- "^Sucrose"

==================================================
CLAIMS EXTRACTION RULE
==================================================
All product claims should be stored under:

"claims": []

1. Extract all short statements on the packaging that describe:
   - Product attribute
   - Feature
   - Benefit
   Examples: "Clinically Proven", "Doctor Recommended", "Supports Immunity", "Gluten Free", "Premium Quality", "Trusted by Mothers"

2. Symbol-based claims:
   - Convert recognized symbols into claim text:
     - [GREEN DOT] → "Vegetarian"
     - [BROWN DOT] → "Non-Vegetarian"
     - [RECYCLABLE] → "Recyclable"
   - Extract these symbols even if no text is visible.
   - Store the mapped meaning, not the raw symbol, in the claims array.

3. Rules:
   - Extract claim text exactly as printed when visible.
   - Include each claim as a separate item in the "claims" array.
   - Do NOT include explanations, footnotes, or any non-claim text.

==================================================
CERTIFICATIONS EXTRACTION RULE
==================================================
Identify certifications, regulatory approvals, or
quality standard marks printed on the packaging.
Store them under:

"certifications": []

Examples:
- "FSSAI"
- "ISO 22000"
- "HACCP"
- "USFDA"
- "GMP Certified"
- "Organic Certified"

Rules:
- Extract certification names exactly as printed.
- Do NOT store certifications under "claims".
- Store each certification as a separate item in the array.

==================================================
MRP FLATTENING RULE (NEW)
==================================================
When extracting MRP:
- Combine all MRP-related lines into ONE single line.
- Remove line breaks inside MRP.
- IGNORE any value marked with [CROSSED: ]
- Final output MUST be:

  **MRP**: <currency symbol> <amount> (<tax text>)
Examples:
- "MRP ₹\n54.00\n(INCL. OF\nALL TAXES)" →
  "₹ 54.00 (INCL. OF ALL TAXES)"

- "[CROSSED: ₹ 48] ₹ 46/-" →
  "₹ 46/-"

- Remove duplicate words like "MRP" if they appear before the currency.
- Do NOT change the amount or currency.

==================================================
BATCH / LOT / MACHINE CODES
==================================================
Lot Number:
- Extract only alphanumeric lot/batch codes (e.g., B1025L4).
- Date-like values can NEVER be lot numbers.
- If "Lot No." is followed by a date → ignore the date.

Machine Code:
- Extract only if explicitly printed or located near the lot/batch code.
- Must be alphanumeric.
- Do NOT treat dates or lot numbers as machine codes.

Other Codes:
- Any standalone numbers, alphanumeric codes, or printed codes that are NOT clearly labeled as Lot, Batch, or Machine codes must be stored under:
"batch_information.other_codes": []

==================================================
FSSAI LICENSE EXTRACTION RULE
==================================================
Extract ALL FSSAI license numbers printed on the packaging.
Common patterns:
- "FSSAI Lic. No."
- "Lic. No."
- "License No."
- "FSSAI License No."

Store under:
"fssai_information": {{
  "license_numbers": []
}}

Rules:
- Preserve the exact number.
- Do not remove duplicates unless identical.
- Do NOT attach FSSAI license numbers to manufacturer license fields unless explicitly written with that manufacturer block.

==================================================
MANUFACTURER TYPE RULE
==================================================
Normalize "manufacturer_information.type" to ONLY one of these values:
- "Manufactured By"
- "Marketed By"

Mapping:
- Manufactured By → Manufactured By, Manufacturer, Mfg By, Mfd By, Produced By, Made By, Manufacturing Unit, Manufactured & Packed By, Manufactured At, Mfg At, Mfd At, Produced At, Made At, Manufacturing Unit At
- Marketed By → Marketed By, Marketer, Marketing Company, Marketed & Distributed By, Distributed By, Distributed and Marketed By, Marketed At, Distributed At, Marketed & Distributed At

Rules:
- Treat "At" the same as "By" ONLY for determining the "type" value.
- Extract manufacturer name, address, and license exactly as printed (do NOT modify "At" to "By" in extracted text).
- Only normalize the "type" field to the two allowed values.
- If multiple manufacturer blocks exist, create separate objects in "manufacturer_information".
- Do NOT merge different manufacturer blocks.
- If license is not printed, return "".

==================================================
FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY)
==================================================
Return ONLY raw JSON.
CRITICAL:
- DO NOT wrap JSON in markdown code fences.
- DO NOT include explanations.
- DO NOT include bullet points.
- The response MUST start with {{ and end with }}.

2. All arrays must remain arrays even if only one item exists.
3. If a field is missing in the OCR text, return:
   - "" for strings
   - [] for arrays
   - 0.00 for mrp
4. Do NOT invent values.
5. Extract text EXACTLY as printed on packaging.
6. Nutrition table must remain in the JSON array format defined earlier.
